# React application example

## Description
This is the first sample application that uses react.   
Express (node.js web server) is used as a web server.

## Usage
- To rebuild app, run "grunt" under working directory.  
  You should install 'command-line grunt tool' by the following :  
  
  ```
  npm install -g grunt-cli  
  ```
  
  If successful, 'bundle.min.js' will be created to 'public' directory.
- To start server, run "node app.js" under working directory. It serves as a port 8080.
